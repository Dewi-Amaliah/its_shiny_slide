## Prerequisites

1.  Having R and R studio installed. If you haven't already, you can see the installation guide [here](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/).

2.  Download the helper function [here](https://github.com/Dewi-Amaliah/its_shiny_slide/blob/main/app_demo/helper.R). It is a function to calculate 10-year cardiovascular risk based on Framingham Risk Score.

3.  Having these packages installed: `tidyverse`, `shiny`, `shinythemes`, `rmarkdown`, and `officer`. You can install these packages by running this code:

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
    install.packages(c("tidyverse", "shiny", "shinythemes",
                       "rmarkdown", "officer"))
```
