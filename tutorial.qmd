## Prerequisites

1.  Having R and R studio installed. If you haven't already, you can see the installation guide [here](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/).

2.  Having these packages installed: `tidyverse`, `shiny`, `shinythemes`, `caret`, `DT`, `rmarkdown`, `officer`, `rpart`, `ggally`, `plotly`, and `randomForest`. You can install these packages by running this code:

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
    install.packages(c("tidyverse", "shiny", "shinythemes", "caret", "DT",
                       "rmarkdown", "officer", "rpart", "ggally", "plotly",
                       "randomForest"))
```

3.  Download case study data on Obesity Level Classification (UCI Machine Learning Repository, 2019) [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/544/estimation+of+obesity+levels+based+on+eating+habits+and+physical+condition).

## Goal

Create a Shiny app to do data exploration (visualization) and classification (several classification algorithm).

## Your Task

Based on the lesson, think of the UI, server, and layout component of the app!
