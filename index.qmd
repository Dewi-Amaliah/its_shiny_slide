-   Shiny ([Chang, et.al., 2023](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=shiny)) is an R packages that support web app development using R.

-   No HTML/css/javascript required.

-   Enable data analysis in an interactive manners.

-   As it is developed using R, it can be supported by other R packages.

-   Can be hosted and accessed online.

## Why it is important?

### Especially in Biostatistics & Healthcare

::: callout-note
## Interactive data analysis and visualization enable:

-   Monitoring and analysis -\> quality improvement and performance monitoring
-   Decision support systems
-   Research and collaboration
-   Patient engagement and education
